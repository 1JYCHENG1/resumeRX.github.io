abstract = "The Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) framework has been widely utilized to describe traffic dynamics in urban networks as well as to design perimeter flow control strategies under stationary (constant) demand and deterministic settings. In real world, both the MFD and demand however suffer from various intrinsic uncertainties while travel demand is of time-varying nature. Hence, robust control for traffic networks with uncertain MFDs and demand is much appealing and of greater interest in practice. In literature, there would be a lack of robust control strategies for the problem. One major hurdle is of requirement on model linearization that is actually a basis of most existing results. The main objective of this paper is to explore a new robust perimeter control framework for dynamic traffic networks with parameter uncertainty (on the MFD) and exogenous disturbance induced by travel demand. The disturbance in question is in general time-varying and stochastic. Our main contribution focuses on developing a control-Lyapunov function (CLF) based approach to establishing a couple of universal control laws, one is almost smooth and the other is Bang-bang like, for different implementation scenarios. Moreover, it is indicated that the almost smooth control is more suited for road pricing while the Bang-bang like control for signal timing. In sharp contrast to existing methods, in which adjusting extensive design parameters are usually needed, the proposed methods can determine the control in an automatic manner. Furthermore, numerical results demonstrate that the control can drive the system dynamics towards a desired equilibrium under various scenarios with uncertain MFDs and travel demand. Both stability and robustness can be substantially observed. As a major consequence, the proposed methods achieve not only global asymptotic stability but also appealing robustness for the closed-loop traffic system."
